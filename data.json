                "Body": "Bitcoin is still mostly a speculative asset in the developed world. However, in countries with a history of poor monetary policy, Bitcoin is now a viable hedge against high inflation and government seizure.Argentinas recent history is one of poor monetary policy. Between 1991 and 2002 the Argentine Peso was pegged to the USD with the central bank claiming to operate a full reserve. This peg was used to combat hyperinflation and initially appeared to work with inflation falling from 3000% in 1989 to 3.4% in 1994.The reality was very different, and the strong USD overvalued the Argentine Peso and made international trade difficult. In 2001 the dollar-pegged Argentine Peso was abandoned, and the Argentine peso has lost over 98% of its value with 1 USD now buying almost 60 pesos.With hyperinflation and the capital controls used by the Argentinian government, many locals look to find ways of protecting their wealth with hard assets. While many will use USD and real estate, more and more are turning to Bitcoin as a way to preserve their capital.In this interview, I speak to Ariel Muslera and Diego Gutierrez-Zaldivar about the current state of monetary policy in Argentina, the political landscape, and how more and more Argentinians are using Bitcoin to hedge risk."

While there Gerald fell sick and a few days later died from complications related to his Crohns disease.Gerald was the only person who held the private keys to Quadrigas cold storage wallet, leaving an estimated CA$250m ($190 US) of customer deposits unrecoverable. In January 2019 QuadrigaCX, Canadas largest cryptocurrency exchange shut down for business, filing for bankruptcy in April.While initially it was suspected the loss was down to gross incompetence and failure to structure a contingency plan, conspiracies quickly started to circulate:- Had Gerald faked his death in India as an elaborate exit scam?- When Gerald lost $millions of Ethereum in a smart contract bug a couple of years earlier, had he used customer funds on other exchanges to try and trade his way out of this hole?- Had Gerald lost funds he was harbouring for criminal gangs and escaped to avoid repercussions?To add to the mismanagement of funds and keys the events leading up to and following his death were equally suspicious:- Just days before the trip Gerald had signed a new will leaving his entire estate to his wife.- Following his death, Geralds wife did not request an autopsy and removed the body from the hospital.- His death was announced on January 14th, Despite dying on December 9th.Whatever the course of events in India, the death and mismanagement of the exchange and private keys raise many questions, and there are likely parts of the story we may never know.In this interview, I talk to author Nathaniel Rich about his investigation into Quadriga for Vanity Fair. We discuss the suspicious death of Quadrigas CEO Gerald Cotten, the missing $250m of customer funds and the FBIs investigation.Note: following my interview with Nathaniel, the lawyers representing the customers of Quadriga have asked Canadian authorities to exhume Geralds body. You can read more about that here."

Banks regularly close accounts, credit cards are often rejected, payment operators freeze accounts and standard business services such as employee insurance can be hard to get.With its censorship resistance, trustless and decentralised nature, Bitcoin is a natural fit to help the adult industry solve problems of financial censorship; however, as of now, it is a niche solution for the tech-savvy.In this interview, I talk to pornographer Holly Randall about censorship. We discuss how the industry has changed, financial censorship, whether Bitcoin can be a solution and the misconceptions and misrepresentations of adult performers."

Why are these projects still able to raise $millions in funding and why are investors so divided in their opinions? Are Bitcoiners right that Bitcoin is the only use for a blockchain or are they just toxic and close-minded? Are multicoiners right that this is a new wave in decentralised technology or holding a bias due to their bag holding?How are inexperienced investors meant to navigate this minefield?There are nearly 5000 cryptocurrencies with many claiming to have the superior-tech to Bitcoin; whether that’s faster block times or cheaper transactions, Turing complete smart-contracts or environmentally friendly consensus mechanisms. But at what cost? The key trade-off with blockchain technology is decentralisation, where Bitcoin outperforms every other cryptocurrency in the market on almost every measure.So if decentralisation is key and Bitcoin is king, why do altcoins continue to attract investors despite apparent risks? Is it all down to marketing and the centralised foundations, creators and businesses and are they all doomed to fail?In this interview, I talk to Jimmy Song; Bitcoin educator, developer and author. Following his recent article “On Altcoin Valuation”, we discuss why altcoins are a poor investment, the misuse of blockchain and why shitcoins rely on marketing to grow."

Will cryptography, computation and telecommunications be the 21st-century equivalents of the printing press, bookkeeping and the hourglass of the 16th century?Millennials have grown up in the wake of 9/11, where safety is not guaranteed, and trust is not a given. The millennials early adulthood witnessed the 2008 global financial crisis, living through a recession and budget cuts alongside reckless and immoral banking practices.Millennials are also the primary adopters of Bitcoin, and by 2029 they are expected to be the generation with the largest share of disposable income.

They aim to bring ‘common-sense, fact-based gun policies to Texas’. The organisation is not anti-gun, but they do support increased and more rigorous background checks alongside education to improve gun safety practices.In a previous episode, Ragnar Lifthrasir joined me on What Bitcoin Did, and we discussed why he believes it is every American’s right to own a gun. To continue the discussion, in this episode, we hear from Executive Director at Texas Gun Sense, Gyl Switzer and Leesa Ross from Lock Arms for Life, whose son was killed in a handgun accident.

Alternatively, some see it as a personal philosophy that they follow within the lines of current government and state systems.How would the free market operate in an imperfect world?

A liquid market means lots of buyers and sellers, making it easy to move in and out of a position without paying a premium or selling at a discounted price. Increased liquidity also means a smaller spread (the gap between the highest bid and the lowest ask).Bitcoin is the most liquid cryptocurrency by far but compared to traditional stocks, bonds or precious metals, it is still comparatively illiquid. For smaller trades this doesn’t present a significant problem, however, for large traders buying and selling tens, hundreds or even thousands of Bitcoin, this can present a challenge as even $100,000 can move the market significantly, especially during times of low volume.Large traders have the option of using an over-the-counter service which allows them to place an order which is fulfilled by the OTC desk utilising multiple exchanges or other OTC clients orders to limit the effect that these large trades have on the market.In this interview, I talk to Nelson Minier. Nelson is a Wall Street veteran who, for the last two years, has been head of Kraken’s OTC desk.

By the time Ignatova disappeared, the scam was alleged to have received over $5bn in investment (though some estimates may put it at over $15bn).While OneCoin claimed to be running a private blockchain, in reality, it was a Ponzi scheme where buyers purchased packages and received educational material. During the process, they earned OneCoin tokens, and there were incentive schemes to onboard new users.Once people had received their OneCoins, the only place they could trade them was with another OneCoin user on the schemes private exchange. While the scam began to unravel with the disappearance of Ruja and the arrest of her brother, many struggled to accept it was a scam and money continued to pour in.The word scam is thrown around loosely in crypto, often from cult-like followers who disagree with an ideology that another coin possesses or sometimes due to a lack of knowledge. While some projects may be misguided or have questionable use-cases, not all are scams like OneCoin Bitconnect and PlusToken.Experienced investors see these projects and immediately identify the warning signs; sadly, this is not necessarily the case for newcomers. The language used in Bitcoin and crypto can be confusing, and when regular people hear or read about a project that is The New Bitcoin with promises the project is like buying Bitcoin at $1, $10 or $100, these scams can quickly suck in naive investors.So, should Bitcoiners be doing more to spread awareness of these scams as they arise and what can Bitcoiners learn about guiding new investors from scams such as this?In this interview, I talk to Jamie Bartlett, host of the BBCs podcast The Missing Cryptoqueen, an investigation into OneCoin and the disappearance of its founder Ruja Ignatova. We discuss scams, Ponzis, pyramids, cults and multi-level marketing."

                "Body": "Bitcoin is a public ledger, which allows anyone to view any transaction and address thus offer pseudonymity rather than anonymity. What this means is that Bitcoin can provide a certain level of privacy if your Bitcoin address is not attached to personal information, for example, exchange KYC data.Bitcoiners wanting to protect their privacy must take careful steps, a lapse in concentration can identify you as the owner of a particular address. By accessing a block explorer without using Tor or a VPN, posting your public key online, utilizing a KYC compliant exchange are all examples of how chain analysts can identify you.Because of this, Bitcoin may not seem like the perfect tool to facilitate transactions on dark markets, yet it currently accounts for the vast majority of them. So why is this?Bitcoin, by design, as a censorship-resistant currency enables dark markets. If you want to purchase something that your government deems illegal, and If you are willing to take the necessary precautions (using a VPN or Tor, CoinJoin and not reusing addresses) you can maintain your privacy.Since the Silk Road, Bitcoin has been the most used cryptocurrency used to buy drugs, firearms, identity documents and anything else from dark markets. By tracking the data in this space are we able to judge whether Bitcoin adoption is growing? And, is censorship resistance the only use-case that matters?In this interview, I talk to Cedric Dahl from 1000x. 1000x is a private think tank focused on researching Bitcoin usage data. We discuss dark markets, sanctioned states using Bitcoin and censorship resistance.NOTE: after initially posting this interview I received some direct messages questioning some of Cedric’s claims, company and track record. Wanting to avoid potentially promoting a scammer, I pulled the interview and discussed these items with Cedric.I am allowing the interview to be public as I believe listeners can make their own decisions but with the following notes:- I do not support or promote his business 1000x. I do not believe in tokens and the opportunity which Cedric and his team are targeting.- I can’t validate his record of entering into Bitcoin.- His dates regarding the Silk Road are wrong.- I can’t validate any other of his statements."

As such. seeking approval from a government-run body for an investment fund is seemingly against this ideology.It seems apparent that most Bitcoiners’ motivation behind seeking an ETF is likely down to money. The added liquidity, easy access to investors and media coverage an approved ETF would garner may well lead to a price increase and thus an ETF approval seems like an easily identifiable path to another bull market.Could this be interpreted as Bitcoiners being hypocritical and caring more about the price of their coins than the intended goal of a censorship-resistant currency? On the other hand, it could be seen as a significant achievement in terms of mainstream adoption. After all, nothing aides Bitcoin’s adoption than media coverage and price-driven FOMO.In this interview, I talk to Bloomberg Business News Editor, Joe Weisenthal. We discuss contradictory Bitcoin ideals and challenging the status quo, ETF’s, censorship resistance, privacy and the current state of the global economy."

In the 11 years that followed Bitcoin has proven to be the most successful attempt at creating a censorship-resistant and trust minimised digital currency.Bitcoin was not the first attempt at creating a trust minimised currency, and there were several proposals, implementations and technologies which led to Bitcoin:In the 1990s DigiCash, headed by David Chaum, attempted to make online payments anonymous.In 1997 Adam Back created HashCash using a proof-of-work system to reduce email spam and prevent denial of service attacks.In 1998 Wei Dai proposed B-money to allow for an anonymous, distributed electronic cash system.In 2004 Hal Finney built upon the idea of Hashcash and created Reusable Proofs of Work.And in 2005 Nick Szabo proposed Bit Gold. Where unforgettable proof of work chains would share properties of gold: scarce, valuable and trust minimised but with the benefit of being easily transactable.When Satoshi released the Bitcoin whitepaper, rather than a revolution, Bitcoin was an evolution of all that had come before it with Bitcoin being the most trust minimised, censorship-resistant and hardest currency that has ever existed.Among Satoshis email recipients was Nick Szabo, a computer scientist, cryptographer, the designer of Bit Gold and Smart Contracts pioneer. In a rare interview, Nick joins me to discuss the cypherpunk movement, what money is, privacy and of course, Bitcoin."

The volume during the most recent bull run in 2017 led to exchanges struggling to cope with the volume and some dropping offline. Such was the demand that Bittrex and Bitfinex had to close down new user registrations.Making it easier for new Bitcoiners to acquire the asset has been a key driver of adoption. Good exchange and wallet UX, and education regarding key issues such as private key management not only support adoption but help new Bitcoiners avoid making silly mistakes.The Bitcoin rabbit hole is deep and there are many new concepts which can be intimidating to new Bitcoiners which sometimes OGs take for granted. Transacting alone requires consideration for a type of transaction fee, unconfirmed transactions and the reality that mistakes can’t be reversed.Having talked to Hotep and followed his journey into Bitcoin and the distraction with shitcoins, people told me to ignore him. I wanted to do the opposite as I wanted to learn about how someone new sees the space.Kraken recognises that UX can be a hurdle for adoption, and are working on making it as simple as possible for new Bitcoiners to acquire and understand the asset. They recently hired Bitcoin OG Pierre Rochard to help with onboarding new users and Bitcoin adoption.In this interview, Pierre and I discuss why they were the right fit for him, mass adoption, onboarding, Bitcoin financial services and the lightning network."

The unique properties of Bitcoin could make governmental ownership of Bitcoin a necessity in the future and increased accumulation by governments around the world may lead to the U.S Dollar being replaced by Bitcoin as the global reserve currency.Further, the global economy is becoming increasingly uncertain, with negative interest rates and the Feds growing intervention in the repo market standing as warning signs of an imminent global recession.Could all these factors speed up the shift towards Bitcoin adoption?In this interview, I talk to Nik Bhatia, Research Strategist at OpenNode and Tantra Labs.

But do we give enough consideration to our time?One of the theories behind our decision making is time preference. Time preference refers to the value of something now compared to its value at a later date.Those who favour high time preference prefer to value their current self and spend money faster, while people with a low time preference will make sacrifices to ensure a better outcome for their future self.It doesnt just relate to personal choices though; time preference is an excellent tool for considering money, specifically when comparing Bitcoin and fiat.Inflationary fiat currencies favour a high time preference. With no supply cap and governments printing more money at will, there is little economic incentive to save. Bitcoin, however, favours a low time preference. Being sound money with a fixed supply, Bitcoin lends itself to saving.While time preference finds its roots in economics, it can be applied to almost anything and is how you prioritise now vs future; from health to journalism, productivity to savings.In this interview, I speak to Paul Puey, the CEO & Co-Founder at Edge who are building a self custody exchange and wallet. We discuss time preference, Bitcoin, health & diet, journalism and Libertarianism."

When you invest in an asset that allows you to be self-sovereign and take trust away from 3rd parties, why immediately give that up?While some exchanges, like Kraken, take their security incredibly seriously, the history of Bitcoin is littered with exchange hacks and the theft of coins. In just the last 12 months Binance, Bithumb and Cryptopia have all been hacked, with the latter closing down.There are many ways to manage your private keys, and hardware wallets are one of the most secure and simple options. Ledger is one of the leading hardware wallet manufacturers and has recently celebrated its 5th birthday.In this interview, I speak to Pascal Gauthier; CEO at Ledger.

Usually, a first entry point is a fast-moving bull run where Bitcoin’s price is rapidly growing. Whether a newcomer makes gains or gets rekt, not all will stay, and those that do usually venture down the rabbit hole to learn more.So how do you encourage mass adoption from people who might not understand the full capability of Bitcoin?Russell Okung is an offensive tackle for the LA Chargers and he’s trying to do just that. In September he launched Bitcoin Is_, a conference in LA to help encourage mass adoption of Bitcoin.This show is the fireside chat I hosted with Russell Okung at his event.

                "Body": "The monetary base is the amount of currency in any one country. It is a combination of both the circulating supply and money held in reserve at the central bank. In the 1900s, the global base currency was gold; however, in 1971, the U.S severed all ties with the gold standard and the monetary base changed to being government-issued fiat currency.In a government-issued fiat-based monetary system, the government controls the printing and inflation of its currency. This allows governments to increase the monetary base at will. Whereas previous base money, gold, was hard to inflate, with fiat money it is easy. This leads to, for example, the U.S global base money rising from $100 billion to $19.2 trillion since 1970.With Bitcoin, however, issuance and supply are fixed. There will only ever be 21 million created, with the issuance dropping every four years and no ability to inflate the supply. Could this lead to Bitcoin becoming the next global base money?In this interview, I talk to Matthew Mezinskis from CryptoVoices. Matthew explains what base money is and if Bitcoin will ever become the worlds base money. We also discuss what money is, the gold standard, central banks holding Bitcoin and decentralisation."

In this scenario, Bitcoin would displace all fiat currencies to become the worlds most dominant money and reserve currency. But not everyone shares this vision. Some believe that the economic game theory isnt strong enough for Bitcoin to ever reach hyperbitcoinisation and that in reality, if it were achieved, governments wouldnt relinquish power so easily.In this interview, I am joined by Eric Voskuil, who John Carvahlo described as Bitcoin’s most rational thinker. After starting his career as a software developer, he took a 10-year hiatus flying fighter jets in the U.S Navy before returning to software engineering and Bitcoin.

                "Body": "Stock to flow is a metric used to measure the scarcity of an asset. The only asset with a higher stock to flow than Bitcoin is gold. Gold has a stock to flow value of 62, meaning that to produce the same amount of gold currently held in reserve, it would take 62 years of production.Every 210,000 blocks (~4 years), the amount of Bitcoin rewarded to miners is cut in half. The next halving is set to take place sometime around May 2020 and will see the reward decreased from 12.5 to 6.25 Bitcoin per block (~every 10 minutes).The reduction in the reward means that miners have less Bitcoin to sell to cover their operational costs and thus less Bitcoin released to the market. Historically, this has led to an increase in the price of Bitcoin and with the next halving and the subsequent drop in emission, Bitcoins stock to flow value will rise from 25 to 50, getting ever closer to gold.Will this lead to another surge in price and push Bitcoin to the 1 trillion dollar market cap as PlanBs stock to flow model predicts?In this interview, I talk to PlanB, known for his Bitcoin stock to flow ratio analysis and the author of Modeling Bitcoins Value with Scarcity. We discuss golds stock to flow compared to Bitcoin, scarcity, halvings and safe-haven assets."

In doing so, they miss one of the fundamental aspects of Bitcoin, claiming their sovereignty.Before Bitcoin, gold was the traditional way to claim financial independence. Like Bitcoin, Gold allows holders to take wealth management away from banks and financial institutions.

However, in the U.S, regulators have been more accepting of the technology but the laws that surround Bitcoin vary hugely from state to state.New York implemented the BitLicense, requiring Bitcoin businesses to comply with a complex bureaucratic process. Many argue that this hasn’t improved the space or made it safer, but has deterred companies from operating there.Wyoming, has seen this as an opportunity and over the past two years have implemented 13 laws to entice Bitcoin-based businesses to the state. While Wyoming is not a state you may consider a natural hub for tech-startups that is exactly what it is becoming, thanks to the libertarian principles of those in power.In this interview, I sit down with Caitlin Long, Trace Mayer & Tyler Lindholm.

Through its very design, Bitcoin aligns closely with the Libertarian belief that governments should have no interference in peoples lives or money.Helped by popular Bitcoin books such as Saifedean Ammous’ The Bitcoin Standard, more and more newcomers to Bitcoin are becoming aware of Libertarianism as well as Austrian Economics. However, these can be confusing concepts to grasp, especially for those growing up always accepting and/or believing that there must be a state.So, what is Libertarianism? Should we strive for smaller decentralised societies with little or no government intervention or regulation? And could Bitcoin play a key role in reducing the size of governments around the world?In this interview, I speak with Erik Voorhees the Founder and CEO at Shapeshift. Erik explains the theory behind a Libertarian state, reducing the size of governments, minarchism vs anarchism, and internal Libertarian conflict points."

Yes, it can be easy to buy, but understanding the asset, from economics to the tech, requires a dedication to learning.For Bitcoin to reach hundreds of millions, if not billions of people and overturn our corrupt financial systems, it must become more accessible.The Bitcoin community lends itself to the technically savvy and inquisitive. However, to reach mainstream adoption, Bitcoin needs to work for people who are not technically confident and are more risk-averse.For a new Bitcoiner with little or no technical knowledge, even the most fundamental and straightforward requirements in Bitcoin, such as managing your private keys, is a daunting task. There are no insurance policies, no 3rd party to fall back on, and if mismanaged the consequences are severe.Controlling and managing your private keys is fundamental to Bitcoin and the cypherpunk movement. It is this that allows you to stay sovereign and in control of your finances. Phrases such as not your keys, not your Bitcoin are used to remind people to take money off exchanges and away from custodial services and therefore 3rd party risk.These fundamental parts of Bitcoin are challenging and inherently pose some risk. Is this the model that we take into hyperbitcoinisation? Or, is the user experience entirely flawed? If we are to bring Bitcoin to the masses, do we need some form of custodial services, or can better UX provide the solution?In this interview, I am joined by Dan Held, whos company Interchange was recently acquired by Kraken. We discuss the UX challenges Bitcoin faces, the importance of nodes, advertising and marketing."

The right to own a gun is firmly embedded within the US constitution and to many Americans, removing their ability to do so would be an attack on their civil liberty.Since 1982 there have been over 110 mass shootings in the U.S alone. With every mass shooting, the media spotlight is drawn towards U.S gun laws and polls show that the majority of Americans are now dissatisfied with them.However, as mass shootings only account for a small proportion of all gun deaths, is it unfair to remove the right to bear arms from U.S citizens? Should the small number of incidents change the law for the vast majority of responsible gun owners?It is easy to draw comparisons between guns and Bitcoin as both align with libertarian principles. Where guns give you the owner the ability to protect themselves from individuals and tyrannical gove, Bitcoin allows holders to protect yourself from corrupt financial systems and poor state monetary policies.For this polarising topic, I am joined by Bitcoiner and gun advocate Ragnar Lifthrasir from Guns N’ Bitcoin. We discuss the culture of guns in America, if there should be a limit to the type of weapon you can buy, Bitcoin and privacy."

For two days, Marcus answered tough questioning from both The House and The Senate on everything from Libra’s intentions to Facebook’s previous issues such as Cambridge Analytica.Quite predictably, the creation of a new global currency was seen as a threat to the Dollar and was met with hostility by large parts of Congress, but was this part of Facebook’s plan? Are they using and audacious initial proposal as a way of shocking Congress before ‘revisiting’ the proposal and easing the regulatory path?Or, is Facebook using cryptocurrency and blockchain under the guise of ‘innovation’ as a shield against harsh regulation, well aware of the government’s fear that China controlled WeChat and Alipay could weaken the position of the Dollar? Why is Facebook launching this project? With Facebook, active users dropping rapidly has the novelty of the social network worn off and is this just a pivot to stay relevant and maintain control? For the next episode in my Libra Deep Dive I talk to Preston Byrne & Jake Chervinsky about the regulatory side of Libra.

With these unique properties, Libra doesnt fit into the government-issued fiat financial model or the decentralised and trustless Bitcoin model instead. Libra is the dawn of a new type of money, the dawn of corporate money.Libra has not come without criticism, from central banks to governments to the cryptocurrency community and even the President of the United States, the announcement has ruffled feathers.Following two days of hearings in DC, where the head of Libra faced questions from Congress, there is still regulatory uncertainty regarding the currency. Other governments have also been pushing back, and there are rumours that some of Libra Association Founding Members are backing out. Will Libra even launch? If so, will it revolutionise money?To kick-off the What Bitcoin Did Libra series I am joined by Bill Barhydt, the CEO and Founder of Abra.

If a transaction breaks consensus rules, then your node will reject it, irrespective of what others nodes do. Further, running a full node offers increased privacy and safety.So why do so few Bitcoiners run a full node?Many either do not understand the benefits of running a full node and/or find it intimidating. While there are many useful online guides, most rely on at least some technical ability and not everyone has the inclination, hardware requirements or technical knowledge.The difficulties mean many, understandably, opt to use a hardware wallet, lite wallet and even trust exchanges or custodial wallets to secure their Bitcoin.It is hard to put a number on the number of nodes in operation, but certainly, the total amount is a long way off Luke Dashjrs target of 85% adoption.How can more users be encouraged to run a full node?Casa is one company trying to help by solving some of the friction points around education, design and user experience. Casa offers an out of the box, plug-and-play Bitcoin and Lightning node.In this interview, I sit down with Brian Lockhart from Casa to talk about Bitcoin full nodes. We discuss why it is vital to the individual and for the Bitcoin community, and how Casa is working to make it easier for people to run a full node."

Where Austrian Economists have adopted Bitcoin as the hardest form of money, conversely, Bitcoiners have become aware of Austrian Economics as an alternative model for the economy.Bitcoin is the perfect monetary tool for proponents of both Austrian Economics and Libertarianism. The principles of a free market, removing central banks and taking power away from the state are inherent features of Bitcoin.These topics are hotly debated within the Bitcoin community but can also be difficult concepts for beginner’s to understand. Many have only known a world of identity politics dominated by left and right-wing arguments, and a shift to a society without a state is mostly theoretical. It is useful to explore these subjects, to challenge not only the role of the state but its reach. Are socialist policies flawed? Are salaries caps and minimum wage policies ultimately harmful? Why do free markets outperform regulated markets?In this interview, I speak with my buddy and fellow podcaster Stephan Livera, to learn more about Austrian Economics and Libertarianism. Stephan explains why Bitcoin is the perfect tool for a free market and taking control away from the state."

This was Satoshi Nakamotos message to the world as the Bitcoin protocol launched. Many believe this was also a carefully chosen message to establish Bitcoin’s role.The U.K.s Chancellor of the Exchequer was about to bail out the U.K.s failing banks for a second time. At the same time, Satoshi was releasing Bitcoin into the world as a way of controlling your own wealth, and bypassing the seemingly broken banking system. Now 10 years later, the worlds economy is again in a fragile state with many economists predicting another global economic recession.Bitcoin is seen as the antithesis to traditional finance, and if the global economy does turn to a recession, people may seek solace in Bitcoin as a hedge against legacy markets.Raoul Pal is a leading macroeconomist who has worked for Goldman Sachs, managed hedge funds and advised to some of the largest funds in the world. He now runs Real Vision, a digital content platform with the aim of getting leading economist traders and hedge fund managers from across the globe to share their thoughts with everyone. Not just the select few.In this interview, we discuss the possibility of a global financial crash, how likely it is that Bitcoin will become a safe haven, Bitcoins volatility, Brexit, as well as:- How to get people to care about Bitcoin- The 2008 Global Financial Crisis- Economic boom and bust cycles- Bitcoins volatility being the sign of a free market- How to protect our capital if there is another recession- How the banking system will look in the future- The threats from automation and AI- How behavioural economics is changing the world"

Matt Odell is one of those, and I have a little secret for you, Matt was the trigger for taking What Bitcoin Did full Bitcoin. Having wrestled with this for a while, I heard Matt on Stephan Livera’s show discussing podcasts where he said he liked some of what I was doing. “Some”. So Matt and I had a long chat about this, and it was a trigger for me to realise there is enough with Bitcoin to focus on.Matt previously came on the show with Neil Woodfine to discuss what we would like to see for Bitcoin in 2019. I have though been keen to have him back on for a while, so when I was in NY recently I hit him up, and he agreed to come on.Bonus: Matt’s co-host and the founder of Tales from the Crypt, Marty Bent joined us for the first half of the show. Since starting in October 2017, Marty has interviewed some of the most exciting people in the space, including Matt Corallo, Caitlin Long, Dan Held and even Jack Dorsey and have built their reputation as one of the premier Bitcoin podcasts. It is also my go-to podcast on a long drive.We sat down over a glass or two of whiskey to discuss the podcasting industry and our favourite guests. We also look back at the community split during S2X and consider whether issuance and inflation could be the catalyst for a future contentious hard fork."

He has helped to implement some of the most significant changes to the protocol, including Segregated Witness, one of the most contentious hard forks in Bitcoins history.As others debate the Bitcoin roadmap, Pieter has managed to remove himself from the infighting; instead, focusing his time on improving Bitcoin. As such, hes now working on implementing Taproot, Schnorr Signatures and MAST.In this interview, we hear how Pieter first heard about Bitcoin in 2010, entering the world of mining and selling thousands of Bitcoin for $0.20. I also find out what he thinks of Bitcoin in 2019 and what he argues is the threat to its future.Bonus: we also hear from a Blockstream intern at the end about his experience working at Blockstream and supporting Pieter in developing Bitcoin."

Businesses need Fiat for operating costs: rent, wages etc. and for now, at least that is a gap that Bitcoin cant fill.Most banks have also looked at Bitcoin unfavourably, and crypto companies have struggled to find reliable banking partners. Many companies and exchanges have unexpectedly lost banking services or turned to creative solutions.Silvergate Bank, however, looks at Bitcoin and cryptocurrency differently. Since 2014 they have been building their reputation as the leading bank for cryptocurrency companies and now have over $1 billion in deposits. In this interview, I talk to Alan Lane, Silvergates Chief Executive Officer and find out how they have been paving the way for cryptocurrency companies and are how they are offering banking services previously unheard of in the traditional industry."

Gox to Poloniex to Bitfinex, and more recently Binance and Cryptopia, the list goes on and on.As such, security is one of the biggest challenges faced by any exchange, and there are very few that haven’t suffered from a breach, one that has managed to remain unscathed is Kraken. With attacks becoming more sophisticated and hackers working 24/7 to find vulnerabilities how is that Kraken has managed to succeed where so many others failed?The man in charge of this roll at Kraken is Nicholas Percoco, their Chief Security Officer.

LedgerX also announced the launch of a new trading platform called Omni, which, for the first time, will give US retail investors access to regulated derivatives markets.The physical settlement in Bitcoin is another signal of a maturing market. It means that when a contract expires, the buyer will now receive Bitcoin as opposed to fiat, meaning businesses and miners can now bypass the fiat system entirely.Will this lead to reduced volatility in the Bitcoin price and bring in more institutional investors?

Can we trust those that are developing Bitcoin to do so with the right ethical judgement?In this interview, I spoke with Neha Narula, the Director of MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative to talk about these critical issues. We discuss:- How the DCI got started- Bugs in the Bitcoin protocol- Proof of Work being too risky- Ethical development on Bitcoin- 51% attacks- Government controlled crypto"

With Brooke and Bill being early investors in Bitcoin, Jack working on his Lightning wallet Zap and the family investing heavily in the cannabis industry, it was an excellent opportunity for me to learn more Bitcoin and cannabis."

As people continue to fight on Reddit about whether Satoshi built Bitcoin as a store of value or a medium of exchange, would he have envisaged Microsoft would create decentralised IDs using the protocol?As Bitcoin continues to evolve, it is becoming more apparent that the protocol has the potential to be much more than just money, even more than a new financial system. Bitcoin could change our entire relationship with the Internet, each other and our governments.I met with Jeremy to discuss the Tweetstorm he published addressing threats to the ad tech industry. I wrote about something similar, the decentralised threat to advertising, the common thread being the growth of data farming by silicon valley behemoths eroding our privacy.Jeremy identified that Bitcoin has changed the game, creating an imperative for Bitcoiners to protect their privacy. Other large companies are recognising this too, not just Microsoft with their decentralised IDs, but now Apple is stepping up their game with their new privacy-focused login functions. What is clear is that privacy is now in demand and becoming a tool for competition.In this interview, we quickly moved beyond ad tech and discussed how Bitcoin changes everything, a civilisation change and we may be just scratching the surface. The impact on the Internet and society at large could be profound, killing the freemium web model and giving users much more control over their data and online relationships."

When choosing to send Bitcoin to someone, a transaction is broadcast using the new owners public key and signed with the senders private key, and it is the senders private key which confirms to the network that the transaction is authentic. Further, a hashcash function is used to preserve the integrity of the blockchain.“With this framework, we are able to achieve the essential functions of the Bitcoin system. We have verifiable ownership of bitcoins, and a distributed database of all transactions, which prevents double spending.”The cryptographic protocols are hard to crack, which maintains the security of Bitcoin, but quantum computers pose a threat to this as they would be able to solve these problems easily.In this interview, I chat with Stepan Snigirev about the quantum threat to Bitcoin. Having left his role as a quantum physicist to work on Bitcoin, Stepan is ideally placed to discuss the topic. Stepan explains the weird world of quantum mechanics, the status of quantum computing and the threat it poses to Bitcoin."

Many feel disconnected from Europe, disconnected from the political process or feel left behind by globalisation. Others think that we are stronger as part of the EU and celebrate the benefits of the free market and the free movement of people.There is no middle ground, and the stakes are high. The UK is either in the EU or out, and increasingly it looks like we are heading for either a hard Brexit or a second vote.The process has raised many questions, and I have wrestled with whether we know what we are voting for and why? It appears logical to want to be part of Europe, but as I spend more time with Bitcoiners, understanding alternative economics and political structures, my views are changing, and I have become pro-Brexit.I wanted to understand more about why Brexit could be good for the UK, and after a discussion with Giacomo in Munich, we agreed to record an interview and discuss the topic. We cover why decentralised political power is better for democracy, free markets and both the benefits and pains of Brexit."

Five years on, there is not a single, notable example of a successful breakthrough application of a blockchain outside of money. Arguably, there is not a single breakthrough application of a blockchain outside of Bitcoin.While some may point to Ethereum as a success, but now the ICO bubble has burst, even the fundraising use case has done nothing but create more failed blockchain projects. Ethereum’s struggles highlighted with growing discontent amongst developers and Consensys shopping for a $200m fundraise while cutting staff and failed projects.Why has blockchain become a thing? Why do “experts” continue to push the technology, looking for a problem for the blockchain solution? Are people disingenuous, are they filled with hopium for their bags held, or are they straight up scammers?In this episode, I talk with Bitcoin OG, Jimmy Song about the myth of the blockchain revolution. Jimmy Song explains what a blockchain is, why the only real use case is for money, the problem with Ethereum, and why Gigameg blocks won’t work."

Still, the regulatory challenges exist as companies serve international customers with a broad set of unclear, jurisdiction-specific laws.Bitfinex has a long history in Bitcoin, surviving many of its own challenges. It too suffered a major hack which nearly destroyed the business and faced the challenges of navigating the regulatory framework while struggling for banking services. Further, many of the team at Bitfinex were responsible for the creation of Tether, itself facing many difficulties.In this interview, I talk with Phil Potter, who was Chief Strategy Office at Bitfinex and co-founder of Tether.

While the +84% drawdown has been similar to previous bear markets, the real numbers are brutal. Anyone buying a Bitcoin near $20,000 saw their asset lose over $16,000 and the low in the market.Understanding market cycles and adapting to them is a lesson for all hodlers; there is evidence that the current bear market may be over, and we are entering a period of accumulation. With the recent push to +$6k and Bitcoin settling in the high $5k region, the low for this cycle may be in and therefore now might be the opportunity to start preparing for the next bull run.Tuur Demeester’s recent report: Bitcoin in Heavy Accumulation is a detailed analysis of the market and data, concluding that whales may be accumulating ready for the next bull run, but this is not without risk.I spoke with Tuur about the report, discussing evidence from the blockchain, historical data, risk analysis, how accumulation happens and the fundamentals which drive Bitcoin’s price."

This itself is a good thing; it makes holders responsible for their security and can teach painful lessons if you make a mistake.Wasabi Wallet is leading the fight for financial privacy and includes several tools to improve this with Bitcoin. With Tor and CoinJoin, users have both a network level anonymity and the ability to mix their coins.

Now the Lightning Network is in beta, actively being used and stress tested, questions are being asked about its limitations.Proponents for on-chain scaling have been harsh critics of Lightning, questioning everything from the time it has taken to develop to whether it does solve high fees. Proponents of Lightning often defend it, claiming it is early, and many exciting things are being developed to address these early issues.What is clear is that the Lightning Network has much to prove, and there are risks it will not solve all the issues with scaling and potentially becomes a tool for the Bitcoin rich.Tadge Dryja co-authored the Lightning Network whitepaper with Joseph Poon and worked on the initial implementation. In this interview, we discuss the limitations of the Lightning, why Bitcoin might not be for everyone, alternative scaling ideas, the fee network and inflation."

Yes, Peter’s approach has a bias, he wants the Lightning Network to fail to support his vision of larger blocks, but does this make his claims invalid?In this interview, we discuss why Peter supports on-chain scaling and his Five Fundamental Flaws of The Lightning Network, including issues such as how small payments are not trustless and how high layer 1 fees impact layer 2.Are his criticisms FUD or fair?."

The first Bitcoin exchange, created at a time when people would buy Bitcoin through eBay or forum discussions, and payment was sent with trust. When it launched it, Bitcoin was trading at $0.06, and within six months Jed McCaleb had passed it onto Mark Karpelès.Three years after the sale the exchange collapsed when a suspected 850,000 Bitcoins were stolen. Since then the story has unravelled but remains complex, both in finding the truth and resolving what should happen to the remaining Bitcoin.From the Jed to Mark and what happened with the sale and handover; with Coinlab and Brock Pierce’s claims; with the creditors, the lawyers and the Japanese legal system, finding the truth of what happened and what should happen is highly complex.In this final interview in my series covering Mt. Gox, I talk to the journalist, Mt. Gox creditor and the creator and elected administrator of Mt. Gox Legal, Andy Pag. We reflect on my interviews and discuss the parties involved, the history of what happened between Jed and Mark, the claims by CoinLab and Brock Pierce and how this may all be resolved."

Lightning is a potential solution for retailers but does come with its challenges, from UX to channel capacity.Bitrefill is leading the way in building support for Lightning in retail, both by accepting Lightning payments but also with their Thor product, selling channel capacity on the network.

As more users come onto the network and the capacity increases, users are finding areas which can be improved, and developers are working to implement upgrades.Lightning is not the same as the base chain; the experience has differences which can take a little getting used to. At the moment, users have to create channels and be aware of the capacity of these channels. Further, the lightning network is intrinsically linked to the base chain, opening a channel creates a transaction, and therefore a fee and these fees may impact how people use Lightning.The complexity is a reflection of how new Lightning is but it is improving all the time. In this interview I talk about the economics of the network with Nic Carter and Pierre Rochard, We discuss the fee market, the future of the block subsidy and whether base chain fees will lead to a two-tier Bitcoin."

Despite the many scams, there are projects with honest intentions of building new business models and economies.Are the maximalists right? Should all focus and attention be on Bitcoin, or in a free market should we embrace entrepreneurs who wish to innovate? It is indeed a topic which splits people.While I sympathise with the views of maximalists who time and time again have seen projects come and go, attempting to use blockchain like some magical component for a new industry. I also maintain a healthy curiosity.Will any of these projects exist with meaningful use in ten years? Will Bitcoin be the only successful use of a blockchain? I struggle to find a binary answer, but I do not support the berating of anyone open to new ideas.In this interview I discuss these issues with Chris Burniske, the author of Cryptoassets - An Innovate Investors Guide to Bitcoin and Beyond. Chris is a Bitcoiner, but he is also an investor in, and his view is that we are at the start of a new industry for programmable money and crypto assets. We discuss why Chris is bullish on Bitcoin, why he believes in a market for tokens, the ethics of value extraction and dealing with the pressure of maximalists."

Do pockets of power exist in Bitcoin? Are lead maintainers a centralised pocket of power? Is this dangerous?As people push to build products that integrate Bitcoin with the legacy financial system, Angela Walch has raised key concerns as to the implications for this, believing that The SEC is not paying attention to the aspects of Bitcoin where it could be argued as centralised.In this interview we discuss her paper, Deconstructing Decentralisation, pockets of power within Bitcoin, the risks of integrating Bitcoin with the legacy financial system and conflicts of interest."

These types of performances are rare in venture funding but have turned the heads of funds.The problem with decentralising everything is the lack of value creation, and DApps are struggling to find significant users.

The first Bitcoin exchange, created at a time when people would buy Bitcoin through eBay or forum discussions, and payment was sent with trust. When it launched it, Bitcoin was trading at $0.06, and within six months Jed McCaleb had passed it onto Mark Karpelès.Three years after the sale the exchange collapsed when a suspected 850,000 Bitcoins were stolen. Since then the story has unravelled but remains complex, both in finding the truth and resolving what should happen to the remaining Bitcoin.From the Jed to Mark and what happened with the sale and handover; with Coinlab and Brock Pierce’s claims; with the creditors, the lawyers and the Japanese legal system, finding the truth of what happened and what should happen is highly complex.In this final interview in my series covering Mt. Gox, I talk to the journalist, Mt. Gox creditor and the creator and elected administrator of Mt. Gox Legal, Andy Pag. We reflect on my interviews and discuss the parties involved, the history of what happened between Jed and Mark, the claims by CoinLab and Brock Pierce and how this may all be resolved."

Many people were angry with him at the time, and many still are, but as more information surfaces about the history of the exchange, a different picture has emerged.Indeed, Mark made mistakes which cost users of the website hundreds of millions of dollars but is everything attributable to him. Kim Nilsson’s investigation into the chain of events surrounding the collapse of Mt. Gox highlights that Mark likely inherited an insolvent exchange and was unable to cope with the challenges of a rapidly expanding business under constant attack.In this interview, I talk to Kim about his report, his opinions on the numerous hacks during the history of Mt. Gox and his views on Mark, Jed McCaleb, Brock Pierce and Peter Vessenes."

For years they have battled for a fair civil rehabilitation plan and suffered delay after delay.Under Japanese law, the creditors were due the Yen value off their holding at the date of bankruptcy, to be paid out from the 200,000 Bitcoins which were found by Mark Karpeles after first suspecting all the Bitcoin were gone.The process of rehabilitation has been held up by the lawsuit from Peter Vessenes from Coinlab, and during the wait, the price of Bitcoin has risen sharply. Under Japanese law, after creditors have been paid, the remaining value in the company is due to the shareholders, this being Mark Karpeles (88%) and Jed McCaleb (12%), which would have made Mark a billionaire.To their credit, neither Mark nor Jed wants to receive this money, and the creditors have fought to have the remaining Bitcoin redistributed to them. In this interview, I walk with the lawyer, Daniel Kelman, the architect of the civil rehabilitation plan for Mt.Gox creditors. We discuss this as well as the claims from Brock Pierce and Peter Vessenes."

Gox, though 200,000 were later found.In the five years since, more and more information, research and analysis has pointed at a chaotic operation with poor security procedures, yet opinions range. Some label Mark anything from incompetent to a straight up fraudster while others sympathise with the challenges faced by running the worlds first Bitcoin exchange.In this interview, I talk to Mark about the collapse of Mt.

Use cases for payments were limited, and companies were unable to ship projects which attracted significant users.Out of this bubble, we are starting to see new companies and business models which are attracting customers and creating value. One of these companies is ABRA, which is using the unique features of Bitcoin to create a global trading platform for currencies, stocks and ETFs.In this interview, I talk with ABRA CEO, Bill Barhydt.

We also discuss other relevant topics in the world of Bitcoin including scaling, Lightning and Fungibility but we also consider why other projects are scams and should not be trusted."

The website provided a clear use case for Bitcoin, allowing for the buying and selling of goods outside of government regulations.Outside of price speculation and trading, there are currently few projects which utilise the full potential within the design of Bitcoin: censorship resistant money. Gab.com is a site which is not only making use of Bitcoin in this way, but it has to for survival.In the divisive world of free speech, Gab.com has created a platform which does not censor views, opinions and content which some people find tasteless, hateful and/or offensive. Andrew Torba, the CEO of Gab believes that this is an essential right in a world where social media giants can control what content is and isn’t allowed.There are many examples of censorship across these platforms, from Google restricting search results to Alex Jones universal removal from almost every social media and content platform. Whatever you think of Alex Jones, whether you find his views and opinions offensive, censorship across these platforms and the role that social media companies play in determining what content is permissible is a hotly debated subject.I invited Andrew onto the podcast to discuss free speech, censorship and understand how the company has been affected by their own deplatforming experiences. We also discuss how Gab.com is using Bitcoin to fund their business and thus why Bitcoin is free speech money."

Also, the inherent features of Bitcoin such as censorship resistance and pseudo-anonymity are a perceived threat to governments.Bitcoin’s survival is in part down to the dedicated army of those who feel a need to defend it, whether it is developers conscious efforts to ensure the protocol is free from bugs to voices who stand up and fight when individuals and groups try and exert too much control over the future of Bitcoin.One such person is John Carvalho, an often harsh voice in the world of Bitcoin. During the scaling debate, John was a regular on the mailing list discussions standing up for Bitcoin and pointing out the wrongs of those attempting to take control of the protocol.In this interview, I discuss with John why he feels the need to defend Bitcoin, the different types of attacks and why most people should not be trading."

But there are dark shadows over Ethereum: scammers have exploited the platform, unregistered securities have been issued, and the promise of a new wave of decentralised applications has not materialised, either project have not shipped or proven to have little to no demand.Further, the DAO hack placed many questions over the immutability of the Ethereum blockchain, hundreds of millions of dollars in value was frozen with the Parity multi-sig hack and there are serious questions over whether it is decentralised, whether it can scale and the implementation of proof of stake.Bitcoin itself has faced many challenges and criticisms, so is it right to directly challenge the direction Ethereum is taking and the community or does it deserve patience and time to deliver an alternative to Bitcoin?In this interview, I talk to Tuur Demeester about his recent Tweetstorm breaking down why he is so against Ethereum. We discuss the culture of the developer community, reckless approaches to security, risks for investors and the challenges Ethereum faces with scaling and moving to proof of stake.."

The bear market has taken its toll on many: traders have lost money, companies such as Bitmain and Consensys are looking at significant layoffs, and the steep decline has provided the mainstream media with ammo to attack crypto.Still, we may look back on the 2018 bear market as a good thing. Without a doubt, the majority of the crypto industry has been plagued with scams, poor projects and ideas which have raised vast sums of money and shipped little. Certain naysayers have been proven right with their criticism of Crypto, and sadly, these criticisms attack the category which includes Bitcoin.As companies and projects close, teams face layoffs and investors lick their wounds; Bitcoin has continued to go from strength to strength. Despite the recent fall in hash rate, in 2018 it has doubled, Lightning Network continues to expand, and the user experience on wallets improves. Further, Wall Street adoption is happening, ICE is launching Bakkt in January and The SEC continues to make positive statements for a Bitcoin ETF.In this interview, I review the year with Marty Bent: we discuss the bear market, what has been happening at Coinbase, the growth of stablecoins and what has happened for Bitcoin."

Bitcoin offers people the chance of financial self-sovereignty but yet too many leave their Bitcoin on an exchange, exposing themselves to the risk of hacks, confiscation and exit scams.Trace Mayer is attacking this problem head-on with his campaign Proof of Keys, where he is encouraging everyone to take their Bitcoin off-exchange on January 3rd, the 10-year anniversary of the launch of the Bitcoin protocol.Trace rightly points out that there are many new entrants to Bitcoin who aren’t aware of what happened with Mt. Gox as well as the other countless exchange hacks. In this interview, we discuss the campaign, but we also discuss why Bitcoin is important, Austrian Economics and The 7 Network Effects of Bitcoin."

                "Body": "All too often price dominates the discussion with Bitcoin: an ETF approval will be great for the price, we need institutions, when is the next bull run? Also, naysayers criticise Bitcoin when the price crashes, calling it a speculative asset with no utility. Is price a distraction from the potential for Bitcoin?Right now the use case for Bitcoin is limited for those in the developed world. Sure it is fun to send Bitcoin, perhaps it is easier than using a bank for sending value to someone in another country, but price volatility limits the use case for payments. In the developed world, holding Bitcoin will benefit most if it does become a globally recognised, accepted and used as a form for money. Right now, some would argue the most significant opportunity is in the developed world or with those living in either authoritarian countries or under governments with poor fiscal policies.A regular criticism of fiat is the ability for governments to print money on demand, leading to inflation and a reduction in the value of the local currency. This has been seen most evidently with the failed socialist policies of two successive Venezuelan presidents.Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are an opportunity for people living under these regimes to create and protect value, and trade while reducing their exposure to the risks of their domestic currency.Other use cases exist, from Bitcoin being used to pay women unable to get bank accounts in Afghanistan to companies using Bitcoin to transact outside of capital controls. The common theme is that cryptocurrencies offer freedom from rules, whether those are state or legacy processes.In this interview, I talk about why Bitcoin matters for Freedom with Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation. We discuss what fundamental human rights are lost under authoritarian regimes, how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies increase freedom and how Dem Tech (Democracy Tech) could lead to a wave of investment in cryptocurrencies."

In the last two years the network market cap peaked at nearly $300bn, futures have arrived, custody solutions have improved, and Lightning Network is in beta with a rapidly growing capacity.The potential of the Bitcoin network is enormous, and the Lightning Network offers scale which the base layer has been unable to provide. Together, Bitcoin can be both a global settlement layer for digital gold and a payment network better than the current fiat system.Vijay Boyapati highlighted the potential with his article The Bullish Case for Bitcoin, making a case for why it is the hardest form of money and the best store of value. In this interview, we discuss the originals of the article, why Bitcoin is so important and why we should be bullish about its future."

Only yesterday, the VanEck application, the remaining open application was delayed until February, the deadline for deciding on the application.Jay Clayton, Chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, recently spoke at Consensus: Invest about ETFs, highlighting his and the concerns of others within the SEC. All do not share these concerns, Commissioner Peirce dissented in response to the rejection of the Winklevoss denied application and spoke to The What Bitcoin Did Podcast about her concerns that the SEC is overstepping their mandate, stating “By precluding approval of cryptocurrency-based ETPs for the foreseeable future, the Commission is engaging in merit regulation.”Gabor Gurbacs, Director, Digital Assets Strategy at VanEck/MVIS shares Hester’s frustration, telling me that America wants a Bitcoin ETF and that A Bitcoin ETF faces a higher bar than other markets. In this interview, we discuss the VanEck application, why market manipulation is not unique to Bitcoin and the unfair standards by which the SEC treats Bitcoin."

In October 2016, Andrew Poelstra from Blockstream completed his analysis of the whitepaper and dropped a position paper filling in some of the gaps from the original paper to make precise the idea.In the middle of November, Ignotus Peverell, another anonymous developer, appeared on the same IRC channel with a link to GitHub with an implementation of Mimblewimble, and this is how Grin was born.Fast forward to today and Grin has launched its fourth testnet and is preparing to launch its mainnet in January of next year.In this interview I talk with Michael Cordner, aka Yeastplumer, a developer working on the Grin implementation of Mumblewimble, we discuss why Grin is acceptable for some Bitcoiners, their approach to monetary policy and governance, and how to mine Grin."

Both the corporate and retail financial sectors understand the benefits of crypto, and thus a range of companies and institutions are bringing products to market.One of these such companies is BlockFi who offer loans backed by cryptocurrencies. BlockFi recognised that there are crypto holders who want to use the value of their crypto without selling and therefore provide loans which are collateralised with Bitcoin, Litecoin and Ether.BlockFi also recognises that the future of banking may be very different from the high street retail banking experience of today. The company is arguably a bank, if not, then they are at least a competitor, able to offer a growing range of financial products to a global customer base. While some people do not like stablecoins, BlockFi can utilise them to provide financial products to customers in emerging markets who want access to dollar loans.In this interview, I chat with BlockFi Founder and CEO Zac Prince about why he is building BlockFi, what the future of banking with Bitcoin looks like and how BlockFi is building new products to service a financial world which includes cryptocurrencies."

Specifically, the SEC has been monitoring, responding to and enforcing the rules by which they regulate the financial markets.While the SEC initially took a hands-off approach to cryptocurrencies, they have been increasingly providing guidance as to how they view the different parts of the crypto space. From enforcement action against ICOs which are deemed unregistered securities to ruling on proposed rule changes to allow the trade of Bitcoin ETPs, it is becoming clearer that just because a project is a cryptocurrency, it can’t sidestep the rules which have been in place for decades.The Commission has yet to approve any ETP, so far, rejecting every application. Commissioner Peirce, a vocal proponent of supporting innovation, dissented after the SEC disapproved the proposed rule change to list and trade shares of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust on Bats BZX Exchange, Inc."

Only recently have we seen this volatility with Bitmain, where during the bull run of 2017 the business was generated $billions in revenue and profit, but as the market has corrected, both revenue and profit has seen a sharp fall.The same can be said for exchanges, in 2017 most could not recruit support staff and engineers fast enough, but recruitment in crypto comes with risk. Exchanges are a honeypot for thieves and hackers with wallets containing vast amounts of crypto wealth. Not only must exchanges protect themselves from outside hackers but they too must be prepared for staff compromising data and wallets.Under the leadership of Jesse Powell, Kraken has grown to a global team of over 800 people. To ensure smooth operations, Kraken must recruit the right people and develop robust processes to protect the security of the company, while ensuring that they maintain a healthy culture.As an old-school, early days crypto enthusiast, Jesse has led by example, rebelling against the BitLicense and donating $2m to Coin Center to ensure regulations do not swamp the industry.In this interview, I talk to Jesse about the journey he has been on growing Kraken, the challenges of building an exchange and broader industry issues from regulation to mainstream journalism."

Brave is growing as users are increasingly demanding greater online privacy and the tools which Brave uses to block scripts and ads is improving the experience for users, but this, in turn, is causing problems for advertisers and publishers.Brave is attempting to change the model by changing the relationship between the three parties, ensuring that only ads that real people see on real sites are paid for, and providing a better distribution of income. The controversy comes with the Basic Attention Token, which Bitcoin maximalists have regularly criticised, both for the ICO issuance process and whether the token has any value for users.Brave faces an uphill task in convincing people to use the token which arguably adds friction for all parties. In this interview, I talk with CEO and President of Brave, Brendan Eich about his rich history in tech, why he built the Brave browser and some of the controversies around the token."

The freedom and ease at which cryptocurrencies can be transferred also makes them a honeypot for hackers, coupled with immutable records, there is little recourse should your funds be stolen.People hold their cryptocurrencies in a variety of wallets, from paper to hardware but these still expose vulnerabilities. From lost seed phrases to personal attacks, there is a demand in the market for more sophisticated custody solutions, and Casa is leading the way in developing the space.With their central three-of-five management solution, Casa has targeted those with significant portfolios, but with the release of their Bitcoin full node and lightning node they are opening up options to more customers.In this interview, I talk with Casa founder, Jeremy Welch and strategy lead, Alena Vranova (previously Trezor) about how the Casa solution works, the challenges of managing custody and why design is central to everything they do."

That day is here, but the surveillance isn’t just that operated by the government; from Google scanning emails to Amazon recording your conversations with Alexa, Silicon Valley behemoths, hungry for data to provide their clients with more innovative advertising solutions are operating surveillance operations of their own.These advertising solutions range from the innocent use of location data to recommend nearby restaurants to the more sinister use of data to influence elections, as seen with the Cambridge Analytics scandal.There is a small but growing group of people who are rejecting this form of surveillance and business is responding. Privacy tools have gone from niche to standard. Opera includes a built-in VPN, Brave blocks ads and allows for Tor tabs for anonymous browsing and DuckDuckGo has placed personal privacy at the centre of search.A lack of privacy protection can lead to a multitude of problems:- Hacking- Personal attacks- Extortion- Unwanted attention- Damaged careersDespite the risks of not taking control of your privacy, there is still a general lazy attitude towards it. Integrating privacy as standard and simplifying the user experience is why companies such as Brave and DuckDuckGo are growing. They are making privacy easy.In this interview, I welcome back Jameson Lopp to talk about his approach to privacy and his recent Medium post on the subject: A Modest Privacy Protection Proposal - How to reclaim your privacy in the surveillance age, as well as Jameson updating me on progress at Casa."

Every attempt at changing Bitcoin is a scam!3. Every attempt at pushing people to spend Bitcoin is a scam!4. We shouldn’t be nice to scammers!While the slide was part tongue in cheek, and I suspect point 3 was trolling Bitcoin Cash supporters, many took this as a strict doctrine of Bitcoin Maximalism and attacked Giacomo for it. Bitcoin Cash is indeed under threat, the Bitmain IPO has identified how much Bitmain accepting and buying BCH is supporting the price, and outside of Bitcoin, very few projects have managed to demonstrate use case or adoption.Even with Bitcoin, there are no coiners who attack the entire crypto space, chief amongst the naysayers is Nouriel Roubini, who last week declared war on crypto with his testimony to Congress. The disappointing thing about Nouriel’s presentation was that he made many good points, but became lost amongst exaggerations and falsities.In this interview, I discuss Nouriel’s testimony with Giacomo Zucco, the disservice he did himself with how he presented his arguments and what Giacomo and I agreed and disagreed with.

Alongside process, it is also important to not just analyse the potential damage a bug can cause but also the game theory behind an attack.While the founder of the bug, Awemany, used his discovery of the bug to launch a scathing and personal attack on Bitcoin, Jimmy Song analysed the bug, how it could be exploited and the game theory behind such an attack.This week I caught up with Jimmy to discuss his findings, and also:- State level attacks- Mining centralisation- 51% attack game theory- Why proof of work needs to be expensive- How non-techies can support Bitcoin"

There is now an uprising, a growth in awareness of the value of privacy. People are hiding their browsing activity, and Internet giants are under pressure to be more responsible with data.In this episode, I talk to Riccardo “FluffPony” Spagni, core team member of Monero, a privacy-based cryptocurrency. Monero is often accused of being a tool for the criminals and drug dealers, but Monero is a tool for financial privacy, a way for us to keep our economic activities and transactions private.In this episode we discuss:- The importance of privacy- Why there is apathy towards privacy- Riccardo’s new project Tari- Privacy tools- The potential for a privacy web stack- What is coming up for Monero"

Since then, Kyle Tweeted about his changing stance with Bitcoin, specifically stating TLDR: Im bought in. Kind of.Kyle does split opinion; there are maximalists who think he talks nonsense, some who hold him to account for his over bullish thoughts on EOS and others who appreciate his hard work and the thought pieces he puts into the market.Following Kyle, I have come to understand his approach. As a hedge fund manager, his goal is to create a return on his capital, and he sees blockchain as a disruptive technology which can change the world, thus creating a return for the fund. Kyle, therefore, puts out statements, questions and ideas into the market to spark a debate. He doesnt mind being wrong, insulted or challenged; everything is done with the goal of finding value and investment ideas.Whether you agree with Kyle or not, if there is value to be created outside of Bitcoin then Kyle will likely find it, which is why significant other investors are backing him. In this interview we discuss:Why his view has changed on BitcoinMiner rewards after the 2024 halvingProof of stake v proof of workWhat will be the global digital reserve assetKyle’s article: Aggregation Theory, Thin Protocols, And Recentralization: Augur Edition"

While Bitcoin has many proven use cases, protocols, DApps and other altcoins are under increasing scrutiny from investors and market analysts.While there are plenty of theories on how the financial and technology markets will be disrupted with decentralised blockchain based ideas, there are few, if any, proven and sustainable Crypto startups. This raises some questions:Do any project outside of Bitcoin require a blockchain?Do users care about decentralisation?Are these all just shitcoins?Significant money has been invested in these new protocols and DApps, but many are struggling to ship, and those who do ship are struggling to gain traction. Supporters will argue that we are early, and that patience is required, but are these Crypto startups trying to solve problems which do not exist?Building DApps is hard and smart contracts come with many complications. Still, this hasnt stopped investors from investing and coders from building. Only time will tell as to whether there is a need for blockchains outside of the Bitcoin Sound Money theo"

Ethereum for me was another Bitcoin, but a cheaper Bitcoin, probably something many new entrants to Crypto feel at first. I didnt know about decentralisation, why it is important or the differences between the two coins, I just bought them without thinking too much about it.

Our interview was before the decision of the Supreme Court to decline their petition to have the case reviewed.Ross and the family are now left with very few options and are focused on raising awareness in political circles in search of clemency from the President.If you are interested in the case and did not hear my first interview with Lyn, I would recommend listening to it or watching the interview on YouTube.The petition to the Supreme Court focused on alleged violations of both the 4th and 6th amendments, yet the Supreme Court denied Ross a retrial and provided no comment. The case is widely misunderstood, often with those not aware of the full facts of the case raising the charge of murder for hire as justification for the sentence, a charge which has been dropped.Ross is facing the rest of his life in prison for what was a non-violent crime, and for which the Drug Policy Alliance said:In a world operating on the modus operandi of prohibition, users are often left in the dark and all sorts of other precarious situations; purchasing at music festivals is one glaring example. “The overwhelming consensus among users of the Silk Road,” Bartlett realized, “was that the quality of the product was far higher and its purity far more reliable than anything you’d find on a street corner.” Goodbye stranger-danger, dark alleyways, and unknown/unlabeled substances. The Global Drug Survey of 2015 confirmed this, stating “reduced rates of exposure to violence, less adulterated drugs, more confidence in product quality and removal from street dealing were clear benefits.” Will this access lead some to experimenting with other drugs? Sure, maybe. What’s clear however, is within this system, people are able to better regulate and reduce harm associated with their drug use.In this interview, I talk to Lyn about the denial of the Supreme Court, the support of the Libertarian Party, the petition for clemency and life for Ross inside the prison."

Emotions can flick between joy and desperation as you rapidly iterate your product while dealing with a range of opinions, from users to shareholders.Despite the stories from Silicon Valley, a tiny percentage of founders exit their startup with life-changing money. Even VCs expect the vast majority of their investments to fail, relying on a handful of successes to outweigh this.

A fear echoed by many tech leaders, from Bill Gates to Elon Musk. The concern is the unknown unknowns; while technology has managed to improve our lives in many ways, machines operate by code based rules, but with AI, we are moving towards machines which can think for themselves.AI is already part of our lives, from Google suggestions to Siri and Alexa learning about our personal preferences, but this is basic machine learning. More advanced questions are now being asked, for example with driverless cars, the car may have to make life and death decisions, should these be a programmed set of rules or is the computer left to think for itself? If the car is heading into a crash with another vehicle and the only option is to swerve into an oncoming bicycle, what decision should the car make?What is the full extent of the risk? From autonomous weapons to destructive decisions to achieve something beneficial, AI faces many complicated moral and ethical questions. And the unknowns, a digital superintelligence released onto a global network, able to think for itself, hack and make decisions which humans would not.Artificial intelligence innovation is accelerating, and regulation is light to non-existent. Companies such as Fetch are using machine learning to build a better future, for business and the public too, but are we heading into a dangerous period for humans?In this interview, I talk with Toby Simpson, the co-founder and CTO of Fetch.ai.

Where banks had been dismissive of Bitcoin, but open to the opportunities with blockchain, the demand from institutional investors has contributed towards the changing banking narrative towards Crypto.There is growing demand from institutional investors to hold Crypto Assets within their portfolio, yet these assets present new challenges from custody to regulation. Still, the need is driving forward a growing industry of solutions for those who want exposure to the market.Institutions hold the capital but want to avoid the risk of handling the asset, but with companies such as XAPO and BitGo offering institutional custody solutions and the likes of Coinbase and Grayscale offering products which expose investors to the class without the headache of buying, selling and managing, institutions now have viable options to invest in the market.The banking sector is adapting; Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan have opened trading desks, and the crypto market has gone from enemy to friend. As Crypto Asset and blockchain innovation continues to move at pace, investors do not want to miss out on the opportunity within these market.With over $1.5bn in crypto assets under management ($3bn before the crash in January), Grayscale is one of the leading companies providing products for institutional investors. Their range of Single Product Investment Trusts and Diversified Large Cap Fund allow institutional investors to place bets on the Crypto market without the risk of custody or challenges associated with buying and selling.Michael Sonnenshein knows both sides of the market. His career started in the traditional banking sector as an analyst at Barclays before he moved to JP Morgan and then onto Grayscale in 2013, where he is now the Managing Director.In this interview, we discuss the interest from institutional investors, the impact of the bear market on sentiment and how Grayscale handles custody for $1.5bn in assets under management."

The creation of entirely new forms of money has resulted in a new global liquidity pool, and the traditional world of finance is watching.Furthermore, entirely new token based business models are evolving. These token based projects are raising $millions on the promise of utility or equity, yet much of this new economy is untested:Are utility tokens a wise investment?Are equity tokens a better way of issuing stock?With utility tokens, the velocity theory is yet to be economically proven with a single product. Velocity is no different to traction, something most startups find hard, even with great ideas. If traction is slow, then the value of most of these tokens will go to $0 very quickly.With equity tokens, the promise is different and arguably more practical. Rather than a new economic model, these tokens represent a way of improving a legacy system.Blockchains are changing what money is and how it moves, and there is undoubtedly an opportunity for innovators to create new business models, but many questions remain over how practical and realistic much of this is. Most projects do not need a blockchain, most are raising too much money too early, and many of the difficulties which tech startups face are being ignored:- What problem is being solved?- Where will traction come from?- Will these projects become economically viable?Jill Carlson represents a small but influential group of realists in the space, writing about and questioning many of the challenges the market is facing. In our interview we discuss token economics, raising capital for Crypto projects compared to traditional startups and the general state of the market."

And there are many similarities: from the speculation and high levels of investment to the lack of proven business models.While the birth of Crypto was with Bitcoin, a permissionless, censorship resistance, decentralised form of money, it is the blockchain backbone which is driving many of the ideas in the Crypto space. Still, we are yet to see many, if any, killer applications which have achieved global mass scale or a proven economic model. Some would argue that this is because we are still early and the tech, others would say that the majority of projects are not solving a problem or do not require a decentralised blockchain, but for the space to continue to grow, there is a need for the market to start delivering projects which are used at scale.Blockchain innovations face many challenges, primarily around scaling, yet does this new economy require everything to be decentralised to have value? Are there other innovations within the space which can operate on centralised platforms or make traditional centralised processes more efficient?The opportunity exists within the centralised world to tap into innovative features within the decentralised world of Crypto, yet avoid the failings and pitfalls of decentralised blockchains. By tokenising securities the traditional world of Wall Street money flow can be modernised and benefit from:- Programmable equity- Access to an entirely new, 24/7/365 global liquidity pool- Elimination of middlemenWith the first Dot Com boom, the focus was with ecommerce, yet the killer apps were search and social. Could the killer apps with Crypto be in the tokenisation of assets? It surely makes more sense to hold a token which can be transferred instantly across the globe than to have a share certificate in a drawer somewhere. Moreover, these tokens can do so much more.Polymath is an ambitious project designed to allow the tokenisation of any asset, providing access to a global liquidity pool while reducing the cost of raising capital. The platform is designed to simplify and reduce the cost of creating a security, using the ST20 standard with built-in KYC to ensure tokens comply with regulations.Polymath is one of a number of projects in the space, looking to integrate Wall Street with Crypto and in this interview, I talk with their CEO, Trevor Koverko about the project, the challenges they face and the opportunity within the market.Note: for full transparency, I am an investor in the Polymath token."

These price moves create lots of excitement and bring speculators into the market, yet many still question where the value is? What are the use cases? Who is spending Bitcoin?Right now, the use cases for western nations are niche, and with the recent scaling issues, there has been a decrease in use as a means of payment. While Lightning Network promises fast and low-cost payments, the question remains whether people will use Bitcoin instead of their debit/credit cards or cash in their pocket. Others argue spend volumes arent relevant and that Bitcoin is a store of value, but objectors claim that the volatility means it cant be. This though is relative.On a personal level, I use Bitcoin to pay my mining bills because the transactions are faster and more straightforward than via the bank, but I use Bitcoin for little else. My experience is in a closed loop of activity within the Crypto world. The use case for Bitcoin is broader in collapsing economies, for example, in Venezuela Bitcoin is a lifeline for many struggling with the impact of hyperinflation:- People using Bitcoin as a store of value to ensure that their income holds value- Others are mining Bitcoin as a means to earn an income to feed their familiesBitcoin maximalists often discuss hyperbitcoinisation: the transition to an economy where Bitcoin is the primary currency, and with Venezuela, this is a possibility. The strict controls over the use of foreign currency have led to an ever-growing Bitcoin economy in the country. The trustless, censorship-resistant, decentralised nature of Bitcoin makes it an excellent option for a population living through a collapsing economy.Even the socialist government of Nicholas Madura has recognised the potential of Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies with the building of government mining farms, able to mine Bitcoin competitively due to the control of the energy system to the launch of the much criticised $PETRO as a way to generate much-needed money for the failing government.In this interview, I met with Alejandro Machado to discuss the recent history of Venezuela, government corruption, failed socialist policies and the increase in Bitcoin adoption to counter hyperinflation.Alejandro is a Venezuelan national who left the country in 2015. He writes openly about the failing Madura government for the Caracas Chronicles and is a developer and designer, working on Crypto projects.Alejandro brings an insight into life inside Venezuela, why he left, how Crypto can help the population and his desire to return to his home country."

As we were both in New York for Consensus, Jameson agreed to meet up with me to record a follow-up episode.Since we first met, Jameson has left his role at BitGo to work at custody solution Casa. With the growth in portfolio value, many Crypto holders are managing substantial portfolio values, yet the Casa team recognised that there is a gap in the market for a secure private key management solution designed to limit all attack vectors.In a recent Medium post, founder, Jeremy Welch highlighted the Multi-signature + Multi-location + Multi-device approach being taken by Casa:“Our first product is the ultimate personal HODL setup: 3-of-5 multi-signature key software with 24/7 support. Keys spread across devices on a mobile phone, three hardware wallets and our Casa Key Recovery Service (KRS). This setup gives you full control while addressing risk of theft, accidents, disasters and more.”In this interview, I talk in depth with Jameson about Casa, their solution, his role and what keeps him awake at night. We also discuss other critical topics in Crypto such as his thoughts on Bitcoin scaling and the Lightning Network."

Two sides fiercely divided on what Bitcoin is, who it is for, how it should scale and there appears to be little middle ground between the camps:- Big blockers claim that Core and Blockstream have taken Bitcoin hostage- Small blockers claim that Bitcoin Cash is a false Bitcoin and is stealing the brandHaving met with Roger Ver, I wanted to discuss this with someone from the small block side, and Samson Mow, Chief Strategy Officer at Blockstream, agreed to meet me before the Consensus conference in New York.One topic I avoided discussing was the collusion between Core and Blockstream, firstly, from what I can see, any accusation is circumstantial, and secondly, Samson has already answered this, and I suspect, would answer it the same.What I wanted to do was understand the incentives for Blockstream and look further into the role of Lightning Network in the scaling of Bitcoin. I think it is difficult to deny that for Bitcoin to scale to support millions of users globally, second layer technologies are required, even Roger ver agrees, but at what cost?What I struggle with is the relationship between Lightning Network and the main chain. I struggle with the fee market on the main chain and how users around the world might one day be priced out of using it, and thus, not available to have the opportunity to core Bitcoin features such as cold storage. I dont like tiered security features based on wealth, especially as we are always advised to protect our private keys with our lives.Maybe this will be solved in the future, and maybe this is the way the free market must work. I dont have the answer but is something Samson, and I discuss in detail, and you will be able to hear my frustrations with this.Small blocks undoubtedly suit Blockstreams business model but are they building a business on top of the right scaling solution or are they pushing a scaling solution which suits their interest. I dont buy the conspiracy but understand why bitter big blockers are suspicious."

What some believe is fair and open criticism has led to social intimidation where the act of creating content is now objected to, even before the content has been seen or heard.Abuse, false accusations and overt pressure from key personalities in the Crypto community has made me question who I should interview, how I should conduct an interview and the beliefs I should form.The same people who want censorship-free money are happy to intimidate free thought.I have also faced contradictory accusations that if you interview a scammer, you are only doing it to gain followers and because you interviewed Roger, you will lose a lot of respect and followers.Well, which is it?It is neither, I appreciate every follower I have, and yes, I want to grow my followers and the reach of my podcast but I do my interviews whether or not this will lead to a net gain or loss.In preparing the intro for my podcast and even writing this, I am sat here questioning my free thought. There is a nervousness that if I am open about my experience with Roger that the Bitcoin community will ostracise me, I’ll be hung out to dry as a heathen, a turncoat, a fucking big blocker.Hang the bastard!Going into my interview with Roger, I was firmly in the small block camp, but in preparing my interview, I wanted to be as impartial as I could. Surely there are things we can learn from everyone, and if we learn nothing new, we lost nothing trying.Nothing about my experience with Roger convinced me that big blocks are the solution to Bitcoin scaling, but plenty of my experience with him confirmed for me that I was right to go and see him.I liked Roger, there I said it, I liked your villain!But the Roger I liked was the guy I met off camera, the relaxed Roger who wasn’t defending the same questions with the same answers. It was the Roger I discussed the plight of Ross Ulbricht with, the Roger who talked about the ideals of freedom from the state, the Roger who sat back with his arms behind his head, not on the edge of his seat, ready to attack.The only way I got to know this Roger was by flying halfway around the world to meet him, by spending time with him either side of the interview and being respectful to him. Something many of you reading this wont get to experience because all you see is Bitcoin Cash Roger, rage quitting with a middle finger to John Carvalho or talking about dying babies at Deconomy.And even writing the above, I can picture the responses, this is how people like Roger work, they trick you with being nice and then trap you. The social intimidation is real, the fear of what how people will react when I say, yeah, you know what, he’s alright, is real.Sadly, if you dont attack Roger and call him out for his bullshit, then you aren’t a proper journalist, and you’re one of them. Dont worry, I called him out."

                "Body": "Only recently, Ethereum founder, Vitalik Buterin called out Craig as a fraud at the Deconomy conference and questioned whether he should be allowed to speak at such events. Litecoin founder, Charlie Lee, added to the debate, stating I will not attend or speak at any conference that invites CSW to speak.While few believe that Craig is Satoshi, there is a small group of respected people he managed to convince he is, most notably, Gavin Andreson, who wrote in his blog about why he believes that Craig is Satoshi. He was not the only one, Jon Matonis, founding director of the Bitcoin Foundation also claimed that Craig Wright is Satoshi, stating how he had a weird feeling of having just met Satoshi.Despite these people having claimed they have seen proof that Craig is Satoshi, and stated he would publicly prove he is, he never did. Craigs position is now to neither admit or deny. Further, many have uncovered evidence of lying and fabrication.Few people in the Crypto community believe he is or could be, yet I approached the interview with an open mind. I read everything I could with two objectives:- Either convince myself conclusively that Craig is Satoshi- Or convince myself conclusively that Craig isnt SatoshiAnd I could do neither. He is either a hugely misunderstood person, who invented Bitcoin but does not fit the hero picture people have for Satoshi or is is a complete fraud. While there are clear and serious questions about his character and honesty, I cannot conclusively say that he isnt.The areas which leave a small window of doubt for me are as follows:He did manage to prove to Gavin Andreson, amongst others. So either Gavin was in on the con, which I doubt very much, Gavin was the victim of an elaborate con or Craig did provide conclusive proof. Gavins blog post is worth reading.The details of the Kleinman case. Again, I suggest reading the details of the case and the full submission. While this is not proof that Craig is Satoshi, they were both undeniably involved with Bitcoin from very early on and managed to accumulate vast amounts of Bitcoin.I appreciate that I open myself up to criticism by even suggesting the possibility he could be Satoshi, I am okay with this. I think it is important with situations like this to keep an open mind.Do I believe that Craig is Satoshi, no I dont.Do think there is a possibility, that if Satoshi is a group of people, then Craig could have somehow been involved or was close enough to the project in the early days to make a claim, or use it to construct a fraud, sure.I enjoyed the interview, but I also recognise the flaws in his character. But Craig is still a human, and whoever Satoshi is, that person could also be deeply flawed. Others will likely point to more technical reasons why Craig isnt, for example, the criticisms of his writing and white papers and the more I read, the more I doubt he is.Outside of the Satoshi question, Craig is a proponent of on-chain scaling, working on projects to grow and expand Bitcoin Cash. He is aggressively pursuing patents in this area, something which is questionable in a largely open source community.Whatever you think of Craig, if you listen to the interview and you want to discuss it with me, then please do get in touch."

Just as slavery has been abolished most everywhere, I believe violence, coercion and all forms of force by one person over another can come to an end. The most widespread and systemic use of force is amongst institutions and governments, so this is my current point of effort. The best way to change a government is to change the minds of the governed, however. To that end, I am creating an economic simulation to give people a first-hand experience of what it would be like to live in a world without the systemic use of force.Two technologies enabled Ross to achieve his goals with the website:The Tor Browser: enabled the IP address of the server hosting the website to be hidden, while also allowing users to browse and purchase from the website anonymously.Bitcoin: enabled buyers and sellers to transact anonymously with each other without using debit or credit cards.*While the website allowed for the trade of any goods, it was primarily used for and became synonymous with drugs. with listings for all types of recreational and over the counter drugs in almost any quantity.One of the key features of the website was the ability to leave reviews of sellers, which led to a fairer system than the street trade. Sellers did not want to risk losing business, so they could set the grade of their products. This also, arguably, protected buyers by reducing the risk of bad batches and sellers cutting their products with other impurities, something is often seen in the street trade to increase profits.Ross created a pseudonym, Dread Pirate Roberts, to act as the master admin for the site and he claimed he passed this onto another person early on in the project. It was this pseudonym and master admin became the target of multiple law enforcement agencies, across the world.In October 2013, the FBI was able to access the servers and close down the website. Ross was apprehended in an uncover sting at the San Francisco Library on October 2nd and charged with:- Possession with intent to distribute controlled substances (dropped in sentencing)- Distribution of narcotics by means of the internet- Narcotics trafficking conspiracy (dropped in sentencing)- Computer hacking conspiracy- Fake ID trafficking conspiracy- Money laundering conspiracy- Continuing criminal enterprise, aka the kingpin chargeOn 4 February 2015, Ross was convicted of seven charges and received a double life sentence + 40 years, condemning Ross to spend the rest of his life in prison.The case presents many complex issues, from the harshness of the sentence to the role of the state. The subject is highly emotive with valid arguments on both sides of the drugs debate. Some argue that the war on drugs is a failure and the Silk Road enabled buyers and sellers to transact in a safe and non-violent way, while opponents would say that the website made it too easy for vulnerable people to gain access to dangerous and hard drugs.The case also brings up wider topics for discussion, should we as humans be free to put in our bodies what we choose or do we need protection from the state? Why is alcohol legal when other drugs arent?The Silk Road included information for buyers on the safe use of drugs and Meghan Ralston, a former harm reduction manager for the Drug Policy Alliance, was quoted as saying that the Silk Road was:A peaceful alternative to the often deadly violence so commonly associated with the global drug war, and street drug transactions.Ross lawyers have petitioned Supreme Court, asking them to review and reconsider the lower court’s decision, based on constitutional violations in the investigation and at sentencing. If the Supreme Court rejects this, he will essentially run out of options and will spend the rest of his life in prison.In this interview I talk to Lyn Ulbricht, Rosss mother about Ross, his arrest, the case and the US prison system. Lyn raises important questions around the harshness of the sentence and the growth in life sentences for non-violent crimes.Ross arrest and incarceration has had a deep impact on Lyn and the rest of the family. Our interview takes place 27th March, Ross birthday, and it is clear how worried she is about the Supreme Court ruling. Outside of the argument over sentencing, this is a mother who has effectively lost her son to the prison system. Her relationship with him is confined to family rooms at the prison and phone calls. She may never get to watch her son get married or have children and is spending her time fighting the case.Whatever your opinion, I encourage you to listen to this with an open mind. I also encourage you to read and research the facts of the case as there is so much misinformation out there.Peter* Note: Bitcoin is not entirely anonymous, the blockchain can be scanned and purchases tracked if a wallet can be associated with an identity."
